# Coding Challenge

This is my submission for the SamKnows coding challenge. First off, I'm sorry, I didn't fork the repo!

## Converter

### Nice to Haves

- I would use a locale based formatter for displaying the value properly, for example for currencies that don't use cents such as Yen. I would use a library for this.

## Flatten

In order to not spend too much time dealing with webpack/babel boilerplate, I decided to just write to work with node.js. The version I am using is `v14.3.0`.

This was developed with TDD principles. You can run tests with:

```
npm i
npm run test
```
